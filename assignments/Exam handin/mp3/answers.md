MINI PROJECT 3
==================

ASSIGNMENT ANSWERS
------------------


PART A
------------------

1. Is your system:
	- a publish/subscribe 
	- a message 
	- a structured P2P 
	- an unstructured P2P 
	- a distributed set 
	- a distributed hash table implementation?
2. What is the average-case, best-case, and worst-case space consumed at each Node?
3. What is the average-case, best-case and worst-case number and size of messages being sent as a result of 
	- A PUT message from a client, and
	- A successful GET message from a client (that is, a value is found and sent back.)
	- An unsuccessful GET message from a client (that is, no value is found.)
4. Based on 2 and 3, write a paragraph or two on the current scalability of your system. 
5. Based on 2, 3 and 4, give suggestions for improving the scalability of your system. 


PART B
------------------

1. Briefly explain your solution and why it works. 
2. What is the average-case, best-case, and worst-case space consumed at each Node?
3. What is the average-case, best-case and worst-case number and size of messages being sent as a result of 
	- A PUT message from a client, and
	- A successful GET message from a client (that is, a value is found and sent back.)
	- An unsuccessful GET message from a client (that is, no value is found.)
4. Write a paragraph or two suggesting improvements to scalability that does not compromise your one-node-resiliency.
5. If your solution provides exactly one-node-resiliency, write a paragraph or two suggesting methods your one-node-resiliency can be expanded to n-node resiliency, assuming your network has time to reconfigure itself in between node failures.
